  "description": "Last mile transportation is a concerning issue in several cities in the country. This is due to lack of infrastructure and the lack of information services. Economy is governed by the Demand and Supply equilibrium. We believe that we can design a system that can inform the Auto-Rickshaw drivers of the demand in advance. Consider an example of a traveler on a bus. The booking for the seat on the bus is done 30 days to 7 hours before departure. Considering situational delays, the bus arrives at the destination close to the predicted time of arrival. In this situation, The Auto-Rickshaw drivers of the Destination city can be informed in advance about the number of passengers arriving at said destination at said time. This Matches the Demand with the Supply through an apt bridge of information provided by our system. This system proves to be beneficial for the travelers as well as the Auto-Rickshaw drivers who can get an assurance of a trip in advance",
